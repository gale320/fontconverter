# Font and image converter for MCU projects

This tool was originally developed for my other project [ESP8266 Weather display](https://github.com/andrei7c4/weatherdisplay).
The tool supports font files generated by [BMFont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont) and image files in common formats. It generates .c file with data arrays containing bitmap representation of the font or image. This file can then be added to your project (which will probably involve a microcontroller and a graphic display).

The tool takes care that every font character or image bitmap width is dividable by 8. Depending on the threshold setting, it will ether scale the bitmap width down to the nearest low boundary or add white space so the width increases to the nearest high boundary. When bitmap width is dividable by 8 it is easy and fast to copy the bitmap from the flash directly to the frame buffer. This is especially important if you need to render big fonts with a slow microcontroller.

In order to build this application, you need to have [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2) installed.
